# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of a Library
Management System.


# SRS (Procedure):
1. Member/Patron Service Procedures This covers the actions a Member (such as a student or
faculty) performs to interact with the library collection:
Registration: A person must first REGISTER MEMBER with the system to become an active borrower.
Discovery: The Member needs to SEARCH BOOK or CHECK AVAILABILITY OF BOOK to find desired
materials.
Acquisition/Borrowing: The Member proceeds to ISSUE BOOK (borrow) for a set period.
If a book is currently unavailable, the Member can RESERVE BOOK.
The Member may RENEW BOOK to extend the loan period.
Return: The Member must RETURN BOOK by the due date.
If the book is overdue, the Member may be required to PAY FINE.
Inquiry: The Member can use the system for general ENQUIRY services or to submit FILL FEEDBACK
FORM.
2. Librarian/Staff Administration Procedures This covers the procedures a Librarian or
administrative staff performs to maintain the collection and manage members:
Member Management: The Librarian VERIFY MEMBER details during registration and MANAGE
RECORDS (add/delete/update member records).
Collection Management: The Librarian is responsible for:
ADD NEW BOOK or other library materials to the system.
UPDATE BOOK INFORMATION or REMOVE BOOK records for lost or discarded items.
MAINTAINING BOOK inventory and details.
Transaction Processing: The Librarian executes the physical act of borrowing (ISSUE BOOK) and
return (RETURN BOOK) for the members.
The system or the Librarian will CALCULATE TIME and fine, and process the PAY FINE transaction.
Reporting: The Librarian can GENERATE REPORTS on various activities, such as overdue books,
popular titles, and collection inventory.
